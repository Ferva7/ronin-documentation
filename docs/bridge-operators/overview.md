A *bridge operator node* ([GitHub](https://github.com/axieinfinity/bridge-v2)), also referred to as the bridge operator, is a type of node used for acknowledging deposit and withdrawal events on Ronin Bridgeâ€”the blockchain bridge that facilitates asset transfers between Ronin and other EVM-based chains.

## Installation methods

We offer two different methods of installing nodes:

* The [Docker](/docs/tags/docker-mainnet) method describes the installation of Ronin nodes as Docker instances, for those comfortable with Docker.
* The [CLI](/docs/tags/cli) (command line interface) method uses a CLI tool to compile your own node binary from source. For more information, see [Build your node using Ronin CLI](./../validators/setup/cli.md).

## Next step

* [Run a bridge operator](./setup/run-bridge.md)
